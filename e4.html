            Arithmetic is where numbers fly like pigeons in and out of your head.<br/>
            
            Arithmetic will tell you ho many you lose or win if you know how many you had before you lost or won.<br/>
            
            Arithmetic is seven eleven all good cildren go to heaven -- or five six bundle of sticks.<br/> 
            
            Arithmetic is numbers you squeeze from our head to your hand to your pencil to your paper till you get the answer.<br/>
            
            Arithmetic is where the answer is right and everything is nice and you can look out of the window and see the blue sky -- or the answer is wrong and you have to start all over and try again and see how it comes out this time.<br/>
            
            If you take a nuber and double it and double it again and then double it a few more times, the number gets bigger and bigger and goes higher and higher and only arithmetic can tell you what the number is when you decide to quit doubling.<br/>
            
            Arithmetic is where you have to multiply -- and you carry the multiplication table in your head and hope you won't lose it. If you have two nimal crackers, one good and one bad, and you eat one and a striped zebra with streaks all over him eas the other, how many animal crackers will you have if somebody offers you five six seven and you say No no no and you say Nay nay nay and you say Nix nix nix?<br/>
            
            If you ask your mother for one fried egg for breakfast and she gives you two fried eggs and you eat bot of them, who is better in arithmetic, you or your mother<br/>
