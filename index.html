        <p>
            I see you've managed to make sense of the information I sent you. I appreciate your understanding for my discretion. There are important matters to discuss, but first I have to know that you can be trusted with this sensitive information. I need to know if you'll accept your mission.<br/><br/>
            We've intercepted foreign intelligence, but are unable to decipher the contents of the message. It appears that the information of interest is guarded by highly complex puzzles, which none of our best code-breakers have been able to crack. This is why we've chosen <em>you</em>.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Your Mission, Should You Choose To Accept It...</h3>
        <p>
            Is to embark on a battle of wits, solving puzzles, cracking codes, and testing your mettle against the metal machine that stands in your way between you and a prize of great value.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            You will be faced with many enigmas...some of which you may be able to solve on your own...but mainly not. You must place your  confidence in trusted fellow agents; choose your alliances carefully.
        </p>
        
        <h3>A Few Rules...</h3>
        <p>
            You will each obtain unique login information encrypted in the email that shared this webpage's link. Do not share your login information with anyone, <em>even</em> trusted allies. You may, however, share any content on your unique webpages.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            You are welcome to use any resources you can manage...many puzzles may need a quick Google search to learn code-breaking methodologies, perhaps you'll have to reference reading material, or even interview witnesses to obtain important information.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Above all, be flexible, clever, good-humored, and you may enjoy this mission. Best of luck.<br/>
