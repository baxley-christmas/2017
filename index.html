        <h1>A Very Merry Christmas 2017</h1>
        <h2>A small gift, from Ryan to the family. Made with love and JavaScript.</h2>
        
        <p>
            Merry Christmas everyone! Ryan here. I've been working hard at preparing a gift for this Christmas, only to find that my computer was maliciously hacked. I've updated my security somewhat... 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <em>and have been embarrasingly locked out. </em>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Now, it's your job to help me regain access to my computer, by means of outwitting my personal security protocol, whose cleverness must be a tribute to the <em>intelligent</em> developer responsible. (Oh wait, that's me.) 
        </p>
        
        <h3>Your Mission, Should You Choose To Accept It...</h3>
        <p>
            Is to embark on a battle of wits, solving puzzles, cracking codes, and testing your mettle against the metal machine that stands in your way between you and a prize of great value.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            You will be faced with many enigmas...some of which you may be able to solve on your own...but mostly not. You must place your utmost confidence in fellow agents; choose your alliances carefully.
        </p>
        
        <h3>A Few Rules...</h3>
        <p>
            You will each obtain unique login information "encrypted" in the email that shared this webpage's link. Do not share your login information with anyone, <em>even</em> trusted allies. You may, however, share any content on your unique webpages.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            You are welcome to use any resources you can manage...many puzzles may need a quick Google search to learn code-breaking methodologies, perhaps you'll have to reference reading material, or even interview witnesses to obtain important information.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Above all, be flexible, clever, good-humored, and you may find yourself enjoying this adventure. Best of luck, Ryan.
        </p>
